## 3. Features
- Data preprocessing for robust analysis
- Dynamic, interactive visualizations using Plotly and ipywidgets
- Month-wise temperature and rainfall trend plots
- Easy-to-use Jupyter Notebook/Colab workflow

***

## 4. Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- plotly
- ipywidgets
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

### Setup
